title: Delivery log — every PR that reached (or was returned from) the main gate
description: Append-only record kept by per-PR maintainer instances — PR number, scope, verdict per gate, merge or return, and anything the review taught about the codebase. The stewardship counterpart of git history — the WHY next to the what.

# Delivery log

Append-only, newest first. Every per-PR maintainer instance appends ONE entry
before retiring — merge or return, always. Format:

```
## PR #<n> — <one-line scope> (<date>)
- verdict: MERGED | RETURNED (+ short why per failed gate) | CLOSED
- owner: <instance> · coordinator: <instance or none>
- taught us: <anything the review revealed — codebase gotcha, process gap,
  decision that needs recording — or "nothing new">
```

Entries whose lessons grow beyond a line get promoted to lessons/ or
decisions/ and referenced from here.

## PR #8 — oas.web 0.6.0 terminal-faithful session view (2026-07-22)
- verdict: MERGED — all four gates green; approval recorded as a PR comment
  (GitHub blocks same-account `gh pr review --approve`).
- owner: webpanel-dev-terminal-fidelity · coordinator: dev-coordinator-1
- taught us: zero-dep held under real pressure — the hand-rolled SGR
  renderer with a DOM-free marker block (`OASWEB_RENDERER_BEGIN/END`)
  extracted for node tests is a reusable pattern for testing browser-embedded
  logic without a bundler. New POST Host/Origin loopback guard hardens the
  panel's 127.0.0.1 posture against DNS rebinding. Two doc nits returned
  as follow-ups (stale `-J` reference, inverted paste-normalization claim
  in webpanel-dev's knowledge). Release needed to publish 0.6.0.

## PR #4 — session-error surfacing (2026-07-22)
- verdict: CLOSED — approved on quality, discarded by operator instruction
  before merge; branches deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 (multi-dev: tui-dev-1, webpanel-dev-1)
- taught us: first full multi-dev run; failure modes recorded in
  lessons/multi-dev-run-failure-modes.md and fixed in v0.17.0.

title: Delivery log — every PR that reached (or was returned from) the main gate
description: Append-only record kept by per-PR maintainer instances — PR number, scope, verdict per gate, merge or return, and anything the review taught about the codebase. The stewardship counterpart of git history — the WHY next to the what.

# Delivery log

Append-only, newest first. Every per-PR maintainer instance appends ONE entry
before retiring — merge or return, always. Format:

```
## PR #<n> — <one-line scope> (<date>)
- verdict: MERGED | RETURNED (+ short why per failed gate) | CLOSED
- owner: <instance> · coordinator: <instance or none>
- taught us: <anything the review revealed — codebase gotcha, process gap,
  decision that needs recording — or "nothing new">
```

Entries whose lessons grow beyond a line get promoted to lessons/ or
decisions/ and referenced from here.

## PR #4 — session-error surfacing (2026-07-22)
- verdict: CLOSED — approved on quality, discarded by operator instruction
  before merge; branches deleted.
- owner: dev-coordinator-1 (multi-dev: tui-dev-1, webpanel-dev-1)
- taught us: first full multi-dev run; failure modes recorded in
  lessons/multi-dev-run-failure-modes.md and fixed in v0.17.0.

description: Use when a coordinator or reviewer repeatedly verifies stale commits, demands already-landed work, or keeps missing pushed changes despite prior acknowledgements; respond with commit-anchored Git evidence instead of restating that the work is done.

# Break stale-verification loops with commit-anchored evidence

Use this protocol when coordination gets stuck because the other side is
checking old commits or asking for work that is already on the remote branch.
The background lesson is `soul/knowledge/lessons/coordinator-stale-verification-loop.md`.

## Steps

1. ACK the specific mails or requests the other side named, even if you already
   acknowledged them earlier.
2. Show the remote branch head with `git ls-remote origin <branch>` and include
   the head SHA in the reply.
3. If they cite an older commit, prove ancestry with
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor <claimed-commit> origin/<branch>`.
4. Pin feature evidence to the exact remote blob with
   `git show origin/<branch>:<file> | grep -c <pattern>` or an equivalently
   reproducible blob-at-head command.
5. When grepping for removed public surface, separate negation mentions such as
   "There is NO public X" from live API or user-facing surface.
6. Tell the coordinator the exact command they can run to re-verify the current
   head.
7. Invite them to quote `file@head` for anything still missing; fix quoted
   head-state defects, but do not rework already-landed changes from stale
   commit evidence.

## Gotchas

- Restating "it's done" can prolong the loop; prefer reproducible evidence.
- A commit being stale is not enough by itself. Show both branch head and
  ancestry so the other side can see the stale commit is already included.
- Some coordinator loop detectors key on explicit ACK references rather than
  message delivery state; keep naming the acknowledged mails each round.
